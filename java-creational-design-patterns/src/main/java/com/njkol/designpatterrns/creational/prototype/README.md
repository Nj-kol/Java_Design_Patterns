
# Prototype pattern

* Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires
   a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.
   
* Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature.
  It should not be done by any other class.
  
* However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision.
