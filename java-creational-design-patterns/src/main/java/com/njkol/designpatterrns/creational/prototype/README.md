# Prototype pattern (Also known as: Clone)

* Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing
* An object that supports cloning is called a prototype. Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature.It should not be done by any other class
* However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision

## Identification

The prototype can be easily recognized by a clone or copy methods, etc.
